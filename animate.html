                        <h2>Sylven Republic</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Sylvan Republic is a land of lush forests, 
                            rivers, and populated by all kinds of fey. Their 
                            culture is built upon their reverence to nature, 
                            as well as their power.  Their religious devotion to
                            nature has granted the Sylvan Republic the powers of 
                            nature. The republic has many druids, shamans, and 
                            other powerful fey creatures leading its armies, all
                            of which revere the forest and live simple lives.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Most of the lands inside the Sylvan Republic is an 
                            untamed wilderness, civilization has barely touched 
                            these lands, though there are a few small 
                            settlements, as most of the population are fey, the
                            need for settlements is minimal. With this fact in 
                            hand, these lands prove a difficult place to 
                            conquer, as the fey use their powers of illusions 
                            and nature to keep potential threats at bay. Though
                            the fey can call upon the more dangerous forces of
                            nature when the situation grows dire. Such as 
                            summoning powerful beasts, or even natural 
                            disasters.

                        <h2>The Arcanum Technocracy</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Arcanum is a land of wizards and spell crafters,
                            who revere the pursuit of knowledge in all its 
                            forms. Their lands are dotted with universities and
                            libraries, the land is dotted in many towers 
                            reaching high into the skies. The wizards of the 
                            Arcanum wield the raw magical energy of the world, 
                            as well as the powers of alchemy. They forgo the 
                            heavy machinery of the Imperium for alchemical 
                            enchantments that afford the same purposes. The 
                            wizards of the Arcanum are not to be trifled with. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Arcanum’s real power is brought by harnessing 
                            the power of other dimensions. Their lands are home 
                            to a rift, a place where the energies of other 
                            dimensions seep in, along with these other realm’s
                            powerful magical creatures. Harnessing these 
                            energies have given the Arcanum great power, and 
                            their alchemists have mastered distillation of this 
                            raw magical energy.

                    <div id="imperiumInfo">
                        <h2>The Imperium</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Imperium is a powerful war machine, built on 
                            powerful machines and technology. Their lands are 
                            dotted by soot spewing machines and factories 
                            fueling their imperial war machine. But with their 
                            powerful technology, they wield powerful weapons, 
                            such as machine guns, tanks, and airplanes, but they
                            also have towering walkers lumbering on the 
                            battlefield, some look more like ships on land. The 
                            Imperium is a military state, with many soldiers 
                            trained with unresolved discipline. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The Imperium’s war machine is matched only by its 
                            cunning and ambitious ruler. The Imperium looks to 
                            rid the lands of the dangerous orc clans once and 
                            for all, as well as ending the undead menace. But 
                            doing so requires time and calculated skirmishes, to
                            weaken the clans. Though this is a long and tedious 
                            process, as a full-scale war would not end well, as 
                            it is obvious that once the Imperium has claimed the
                            Black Steel Clans in the south, they will move on to
                            try and claim the rest of the lands.

                        <h2>The Black Steel Clans</h2>
                        <p>
                            The Black Steel Clans are a land of barbaric clans 
                            of Orcs, goblins, and the undead. The nomadic tribes
                            constantly wander their harsh and tainted lands, 
                            seeking food from their volcanic lands. While most 
                            of the time, the clans are more occupied with 
                            fighting amongst themselves, every so often, a 
                            powerful warlord is able to unite the land under his
                            banner, and during these times the other nations of 
                            the world must combat the hordes of goblins, orcs, 
                            and undead. The Black Steel Clans are not just 
                            lumbering hordes, but also wield the dark magic of 
                            necromancy and witchcraft. The Orc shamans wield 
                            this terrible magic against their enemies.

                        <p>
                            The Black Steel Clans have been the scourge of the 
                            land. Every few decades, their true master emerges, 
                            a powerful lich. Many wars have been fought to end 
                            the lich, but so far no attempts have succeeded. The
                            lich leads the Orc clans, along with hordes of the 
                            undead to one day take everything over. It is the 
                            Lich’s dark presence that has tainted these lands, 
                            but it is also what gives this land strength. The 
                            beats here have adapted to the dark energies, and 
                            have evolved into monstrous creatures, ever 
                            hungering for life.
