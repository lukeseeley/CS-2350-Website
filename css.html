            CSS is a powerful tool for creating web pages. But there are many
            properties to keep straight. This page will act as a guide through
            the many systems and attributes that you can manipulate with CSS
            to make your web page stunning.
        </p>
        <section>
        <h2>CSS Box Model</h2>
        <div class="pad1">
            Padding Set: 20 pixels on all 4 sides. This is controlled by the
            padding property in CSS. and looks like padding: 20px; Entering a
            single number on this combined property sets all padding sides to
            the value.
        </div>
        <div class="pad2">
            Padding Set: 20 pixels on the top and bottom, and 50px on the left
            and right. The CSS property looks like padding: 20px 50px; Entering
            2 values will have the first value control the top and bottom
            values, while the second one controls left and right values.
        </div>
        <div class="pad3">
            Padding Set: 100px 20px 40px 80px, Each of the 4 numbers correlates
            to a single side, starting from the top and then working around
            clockwise from there. Each of the 4 values corresponds to a single
            side.
        </div>
        <div class="margin1">
            Margin Set: none, This is controlled with the CSS property margin,
            though in this case we will only be using the left margin. Or
            margin-left. The default is also none.
        </div>
        <div class="margin2">
            Margin Set: 50px, as you can see the margin is the space around the
            box, and the box has been pushed over from the left side. This
            looks like: margin-left: 50px;
        </div>
        <div class="margin3">
            Margin Set: 140px, as you can see that increasing the margin value
            moved the margin much further. This looks like margin-left: 140px;
        </div>
        </section>

        <h2>CSS Style on Hover</h2>
        <p>
            Before CSS, web pages were not responsive in design without adding
            code. However CSS offers limited responsive design with the hover
            hover property. This property allows you to have the appearance of
            something change when the mouse is over the item. This can simply
            have a color change, but you can potentially do a lot with this
            simple feature. To set an element on hover you simply need: 
            element:hover in your css. This becomes especially powerful when 
            you use transitions and transformations.
        </p>
        <div class="hover1">
            Hover Set: none, as you see nothing happens when you hover your
            mouse over.
        </div>
        <div class="hover2">
            Hover Set: Color, as you see, hovering your mouse over this slowly
            shifts the color. This is done by setting the hover with a 
            different color, and using a transition: background-color, not
            in the same block as the hover.
        </div>
        <div class="hover3">
            Hover Set: Width, as you can see, hovering your mouse over this
            shifts the width of the box outwards. Similar to the color, you
            simply change the width of the element in a element:hover section
            in your css, and include a transition in the elements section.
        </div>
        </section>
        <section>
        <h2>Color Contrast</h2>
        <table>
            <tr>
                <th>Text</th>
                <th>Background Color</th>
                <th>Text Color</th>

                <td>2.81:1</td>

                <td>2.66:1</td>

        <h2>CSS Positioning</h2>
        <p>
            CSS positioning is a powerful tool to have an even greater control
            over your web pages. Normally when you are designing web pages,
            things are listed, but positioning allows you to control where
            elements of your web page are placed. 
        </p>
        <div class="posRel">
            This block of text is placed relatively. 
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do 
            eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim
            ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut 
            
        </div>
        <p>
            The block of text above is placed relatively. Relative position 
            moves items relative to where the element would normally fit. As
            you can see the block of text is moved, but the place where it
            would be is still left open for the block of text. 
        </p>
        <div class="Dpos">
        <div class="posAbs">
            This block of text is placed absolutely.
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do 
            eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim
            ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut
        </div>
        <p>
            While it may be difficult to tell, the block above is placed
            absolutely. Absolute does not reserve space for the element, and
            its position is actually based on the parent object, in this case
            the body of the page as a whole. The block of text is actually
            being moved from the bottom of this paragraph up 150 pixels. 
            Absolute positioning is great for giving you the highest level of 
            control of where elements are positioned on your page.
        </p>
        </div>
        <div class="posFix">
            This block of text is placed as fixed. 
            Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do 
            eiusmod tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim
            ad minim veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut
        </div>
        <p>
            And lastly the block of text you have seen floating on the right 
            side of the screen as you have scrolled down. That block of text is
            placed in a fixed position. The position of which is based on the
            actual view port of the page, rather than a position in the body
            of the page, which is why the text follows you as you scroll down.
            This would be most useful for things like navigation elements on 
            your page.
        </p>
        </section>
        <h2>CSS Shadows</h2>
        <p>
            Shadows are a powerful tool to creating parts of your page that 
            really stand out. Shadows allow you to make text that looks almost 
            3D, though it can be used on more than just text. But we are just
            going to show you how you can use shadows on text. Shadows have 3
            main properties which we can show you below. A horizontal value, a
            vertical value, and a blur. 
        </p>
        <h3>Horizontal</h3>
        <p>
            As you can see below, horizontal value controls how far the shadow
            moves relative to the text. With larger numbers moving the text
            further and further from the actual text. You may also notice that
            a shadow is little more than a copy of the text, with blur giving
            it the actual appearance of being a shadow. But we will get to blur
            later. A negative value would move the shadow in the opposite 
            direction. As seen by the 4th N7 below. It does work differently 
            for box shadows as opposed to the text shadows. With box shadows
            This value does actually determine the size of the shadow.
        </p>
        <div class="shadeH1">N7</div>
        <div class="shadeH2">N7</div>
        <div class="shadeH3">N7</div>
        <div class="shadeH4">N7</div>
        <h3>Vertical</h3>
        <p>
            Similar to Horizontal, Vertical simply controls the distance the
            shadow moves up or down from the actual text. And again you can
            see that with larger values, it moves the shadow further from the
            text. And negative values will instead move it in the opposite 
            direction.
        </p>
        <div class="shadeV1">N7</div>
        <div class="shadeV2">N7</div>
        <div class="shadeV3">N7</div>
        <div class="shadeV4">N7</div>
        <h3>Blur</h3>
        <p>
            Instead of controlling the positioning of the shadow, blur instead
            determines amount of pixels that are taken to diffuse the shadow.
            Larger values allow the shadow to feather out more, creating those
            more gradual shadows as opposed to harder edged shadows. And as 
            you can see, as the value gets larger the shadows take up a lot
            more room but end up looking more like a glow effect rather than
            an actual shadow. But that could potentially be the effect you are
            going for. Blur values cannot be negative, as it would not make
            sense to have negative space used for the blur effect. As you can
            see that it spreads the shadow out in all directions.
        </p>
