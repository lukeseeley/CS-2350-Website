            Video games have been a very large part of my life. I have both
            been playing them, and wanting to make them for as long as I can
            remember. While many have a favorite game that they can easily
            pick out from memory, I have a long list of games I really enjoy,
            making it easier to have a list of favorite games by genre. I have
            many games that I have grown to love over the years, and I have
            realized as I have gotten older that I appreciate different things
            from games than I did when I was younger. The easiest example of 
            how my tastes have changed is how much of an appreciation I have
            for the story in games. While I generally have always preferred to
            play games alone, it has only been in the last few years that I
            have come to appreciate narratively deep and complex stories with
            characters to adore, and exploring these stories can be quite
            amazing. And while I have to many games to count that I hold dearly
            in my heart, this is a short list of some of my favorite games, and
            games genres.

            What do I mean by RPG? RPG stands for 
            <a href="https://medium.com/@SA_Liberty/what-are-role-playing-games-even-how-are-they-that-50071c5552e2"
            title="Go to article on RPG's">Role Playing Game</a>, put simply
            is a video game about an adventure with a character that you
            control, in which you often explore a universe full of characters
            and locations to discover. But RPG's also refer to the game 
            mechanics associated with the genre. Such as mechanics relating to 
            mechanics revolving around improving your character through playing
            the game. But RPG can also be more broadly applied to story based
            games that do not necessarily involve complex game mechanics and
            systems. As stated previously, I have grown to really appreciate 
            the value of story telling in games, but I have long enjoyed RPG's,
            even though I did not understand the stories, at least not until I 
            had grown older. These are 3 of my favorite RPG game franchises out
            there. Though there are many other great games that would fall 
            under this broad genre.
        </p>
        <a id="a_ME"><h3>Mass Effect</h3></a>
        <p>
            Probably one of the first RPG franchises that I ever fell in love 
            with, is the mass effect franchise. I have easily spent hundreds of
            hours in the first 3 games, and I have probably beat the first game 
            over 10 times. To say that I hold these games dear and close to my
            heart would be an understatement. The first Mass Effect game was
            released over a decade ago, back in 2007. The first Mass Effect 
            game may be a little rough around the edges now, but back then the 
            game was incredible. I still prefer ME1 over the other games in the
            trilogy, as I feel it has some of the strongest story elements
            and this is a game that captured my imagination quite like no 
            other. The Mass Effect universe is set in a science fiction 
            universe, in which the discovery of ancient alien technology 
            propelled mankind into an already established galaxy full of other 
            sentient alien life all with their own cultures, histories, and 
            motivations. You play as the veteran soldier commander Shepard. The
            story takes you across the galaxy in a quest to quell an impending 
            invasion from a race of machines bent on cleansing the galaxy of 
            life, but until they actually invade in the 3rd game, Shepard's 
            warnings largely fall on deaf ears. While I cannot gush about the 
            original trilogy enough, I unfortunately cannot say the same for 
            the latest game in the franchise. Mass Effect Andromeda. The studio
            behind the game, Bioware, has been on a downward spiral in the past 
            few years resulting from grueling overtime, and woeful 
            mismanagement by the studio leadership. Resulting in a 
            disappointing game at best.

        <a id="a_KOTOR"><h3>Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic</h3></a>
        <p>
            While Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic is quite an aged game,
            it remains as arguably one of the best RPG's in gaming  history,
            as well as one of the best Star Wars games out there. While it has
            aged poorly in terms of graphics and game play, it still has an 
            incredibly well told story. The game mechanics are simplistic and
            based on d20 games (like DND). This has led to the mechanics aging
            poorly in their very simplistic design, which is basic compared to
            modern games. This game is set in the Star Wars universe, but the
            events in this game happen long before the events of the 
            movies we know and love. This game has you playing a character who
            has lost their memories, and finds themselves waking up in the
            middle of an galactic conquest between the Republic and the Sith. 
            You are thrust into the middle of the conflict, where you witness
            firsthand the brutality of the Sith, who completely destroy the
            planet you escaped to through orbital bombardment, in an attempt
            to prevent your ally, a Jedi named Bastila from escaping. Knights 
            of the Old Republic, also contains one of the best plot twists in
            gaming history, of which I won't spoil. But this is one of many
            reasons why this game has acquired such popularity.

        <a id="a_Sandbox"><h2>Sandbox</h2></a>
        <p>
            The term, sandbox, as genre's go, is pretty open ended in what that
            can entail. But in general, it means games that don't necessarily
            have a story involved, and are more focused on allowing the player
            to explore and often build their own experiences. Meaning these
            games are often as open ended in the things they allow for players
            to do, in the same way the genre is left open to interpretation.
            But the reason for my enjoyment in these games is fairly simple.
            I enjoy the open ended game play these games provide. Offering 
            hours upon hours of fun, these games often are great for the
            expression of creativity. A popular game that I would say falls
            under this category would be Minecraft. But these are some of my
            favorite open ended games, that I have probably invested more time
            in than I should have.
        </p>
        <a id="a_Terraria"><h3>Terraria</h3></a>
        <p>
            Terraria is one of my favorite games, that I have enjoyed for 
            years. Terraria is a game about exploring a vast 2D world, and 
            gathering treasure to upgrade your character. Or by mining minerals 
            to craft more advanced equipment. The game is extreamly fun to 
            explore with its vast amounts of loot to find, and the creative 
            freedom it offers with its building system, allowing you to build 
            structures as elaborate as you can imagine. It is also very 
            rewarding to be able to take on the bosses throughout the game, and
            to see how far you have come with your character when bosses that 
            once gave your character nightmares become total pushovers. 
            Terraria is also a game who's developers have gone above and 
            beyond. Even after their initial release of the game, they have 
            dramatically expanded upon the game since then. The game looks very 
            different today, and all for the better.

        <a id="a_Spore"><h3>Spore</h3></a>
        <p>
            I feel that Spore is a hidden gem of a game, that unfortunately has 
            been lost to the wayside, as the original development, Maxis, 
            studio was close by Electronic Arts several years ago. 
            <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-shuts-down-simcity-developer-maxis-1689454903"
            title="Go to article on EA closing Maxis">Kotaku Article for more 
            information</a>. Spore is a cartoonish game about creating your
            own species on an alien world, starting with a simple cell, and
            evolving them until they become a fully fledged civilization. With
            the traits you give them affecting their development in later
            stages of the game. Eventually your little species takes to the
            stars, where you become a galactic civilization. While I love this
            game, and have invested a couple hundred hours into it, I am sad
            that the game can never be improved upon. The game was an ambitious
            concept to be sure, but many of the game mechanics surrounding the
            various stages of your species are extremely simplistic. With
            the early social and diplomatic routes of the game really just
            boiling down to a digital version of Simon says, and the more
            aggressive routes resulting in just simply finding all the best
            weapons to attach to your creature. But the game still holds so 
            much creative freedom to design your own species the way you want
            it to be designed. Resulting in some really outlandish creatures,
            which would not work so well in reality.

        <a id="a_4X"><h2>4X</h2></a>
        <p>
            While 4X games are not as well known as other game genres, it is by 
            far my favorite genre in gaming. I have probably invested more time 
            into these games over any other genre of games, other than perhaps 
            RPG's. 4X games generally are complex games revolving around the 
            creation of civilizations and empires across time and space 
            (depending on the setting). Probably some of the most commonly 
            known 4X games, are games such as Sid Meier's Civilization. 4X 
            games are known for their complex game mechanics, and the vast 
            amounts of information that you as a player must keep track of. But
            I find these games to be very deep, and incredibly fun for me. And 
            while these are a few of my favorite games in the genre, I have 
            many more favorites that fall into this category that I have sunk 
            many hours in.
        </p>
        <a id="a_Stellaris"><h3>Stellaris</h3></a>
        <p>
            Stellaris is one of the most recent 4X games that I have fallen in
            love with. Stellaris is a science fiction 4X game that offers some
            of the best game mechanics, and explorations of the genre that I
            have seen in some time, and unlike many games of the genre, is 
            played in real time, which I have grown to really appreciate. As
            my biggest gripe with the turn based ones is simply the time 
            investment required to complete a single game. Stellaris offers
            one of the best species creation system I have seen in a 4X game.
            While you can yes, determine their appearance based on a number of
            premade designs, you can also choose everything from your 
            homeworld, your government system, and political culture, to the 
            names of your starships and leaders, and your home system. My 
            favorite aspect of the game is the political systems, most 4X games 
            simply allow you to choose a government system, such as democracy, 
            dictatorship, monarchy, etc. Stellaris takes it a step further, by
            including a system of political ethics, which grant bonuses to your
            empire, but also have a large effect on how you run your empire, as
            well as how you are viewed, and interacted with by other species. 
            One of the best additions from content added to the game after 
            release is the addition of being able to play as hive minds and 
            machine intelligences. I love being able to play as a race of 
            sentient machines ruled over by a machine overlord, and the 
            political system allows you to decided to be a race of murder
            machines, or a race of benevolent machines who work as caretakers 
            of organic life. Showcasing the open ended nature of the game, and 
            major reason for why I have like this game so much.

        <a id="a_MOO2"><h3>Masters of Orion II</h3></a>
        <p>
            Masters of Orion 2 is one of the first 4X games I have ever played.
            It was released a very long time ago, and it was first introduced 
            to me by my father. Other games have been released in the 
            franchise, none are as good as this one. Masters of Orion II is 
            another science fiction game about creating a space fairing empire.
            But this is one of the earliest games to do so. And while the 
            graphics are very old now, the game is still very fun to play. My 
            favorite aspect from this game is the ship design system, and the 
            combat system. Though the biggest weakness of this game is how easy
            it was to exploit the race designer to make a invincible species. 
            This is the game that got me interested in the genre. It is 
            certainly a game that helped to shape the genre into what it is 
            today. With many of the systems they designed becoming the 
            standard.
