                    <h2>Favorite Games</h2>
                    <p>
                        Gaming has had a significant role in my life. Over the 
                        years I have found many games that I love to play, and 
                        for a variety of reasons. I have composed a list of 
                        some of my favorite games, although it is not a 
                        comprehensive list of all of my favorite games, as 
                        there are many that I have been playing for over a 
                        decade. I also go over my specific reasons for 
                        appreciating specific games, and their value relative 
                        to their genre of games. For a few games I also go over
                        related news surrounding my favorite games, and some of 
                        the negative news stories surrounding them, and how 
                        these events have affected me.

                    <h2>Publishing Websites <span>on Icarus</span></h2>
                    <p>
                        While it normally requires that you run your own web 
                        server or rent out a server to publish a web server, 
                        Weber States Computer Science department has made 
                        publishing websites on the internet a relative ease. We
                        will go over how to publish websites through Icarus, a 
                        server that we can use to publish websites through our 
                        CS accounts. As well as the convention for URLs 
                        connecting back to these web pages that you add to the 
                        Icarus server.

                    <h2>Adding CSS <span>Styles to Web Sites</span></h2>
                    <p>
                        CSS, along with HTML have really revolutionized how 
                        things work on the internet. CSS allows for powerful 
                        control over the appearance of web pages that just were
                        not possible before without coding in Java, or PHP, 
                        among other languages. CSS is a very visual oriented 
                        way of designing web pages, and this serves as a guide 
                        to adding basic CSS styles to your web pages. Going 
                        over the various properties at your disposal to 
                        manipulating the page to appear the way you want it to.

                        A small but fun interactive mad lib that allows you to
                        fill in the blanks to a peculiar story of a starship
                        captain lost in space. Much like other mad libs you
                        will first be asked to fill in several blanks of a 
                        variety of word types, such as adjectives, nouns, and
                        verbs. Once you are ready you can hit submit and see
                        your words fill the story.

                        artwork is related to science fiction, if it wasn't 
                        already clear, that is my favorite genre. Most of the
                        artwork is created by my friend, and that is mostly
                        because he is a better artist.
