            Publishing websites can be a tricky thing. And while publishing 
            web sites on the internet usually requires you to setup a server,
            Weber State's school of Computer Science has set up an easy way to
            publish your own sites on the internet. Icarus is a linux based 
            server that allows you to host websites through the server. 
            Removing the hassle of having to setup your own server, along with
            finding a domain, among other things.
        </p>
        <h2>Uploading to the Icarus Web Server</h2>
        <p>
            While technically you could publish items to the Icarus server via
            a command line environment, that would require a understanding of
            Linux, and it is generally just easier to simply use a graphically
            based File Transfer Client (FTP Tool). While there are certainly
            many options for FTP tools out there, I personally use Filezilla
            as my FTP client. In Filezilla, to connect to an FTP server, it
            is really quite easy. First you need to enter a hostname of the
            FTP server, in this case that being Icarus. The full hostname is
            icarus.cs.weber.edu. Most of us a familiar with the .edu, that is
            the top level domain, with with .cs being a sub domain of .weber,
            and icarus is the device name. The next thing you need is your
            username and password. Specifically your login information for
            Icarus, for more information on this visit the
            <a href="https://www.weber.edu/CS/tech-support.html" 
            title="Go to the Technical Support page under the Weber State's CS department">
            technical support</a> page. Filezilla will automatically pick the
            most secure protocol and that protocols port to connect to the FTP
            server, meaning you shouldn't need to enter in that information.
        </p>

        <p>
            Once you are connected to the Icarus server with your FTP client,
            you will be able to see what is in your accounts folder. To publish
            your files, all you need to do is drag and drop as many files as
            you want from your own computer directory as you would be able to
            with your own file system, such as shift clicking multiple files.
            This includes folders and sub folders. All files you want to
            be published online can be placed inside the public html folder.

        <h2>How to compose a URL connecting to your Icarus web pages</h2>
        <p>
            While I have talked a little about URL's when referring to 
            hostnames. There are a few components to a URL to consider before
            being able to access content from your webpage. Following is a list
            of the different components of a URL for Icarus:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The protocol (http://), this is the protocol that web browsers
            use to connect to a page. HTTP and HTTPS (with the S standing for 
            secure) are the primary protocols for getting web pages</li> 
            <li>The Hostname (icarus.cs.weber.edu) Like the hostname for 
            logging into the FTP server, this hostname allows your web browser
            to connect to the web page server</li>
            <li>username (~ls40885) The username directs you to the specific
            directory with your public HTML folder, this is the same username
            as what you used to login to your FTP tool with.</li>
            <li>Path (/la2/) This is the path to your specific folder in 
            which you want your link to go to, meaning you can have layers
            of folders if you want</li>
            <li>filename (learning.html), this is the actual name of the HTML
            file you want your link to take you to. If you leave this blank
            your browser will automatically try to go to an index page.</li>
        </ul>
